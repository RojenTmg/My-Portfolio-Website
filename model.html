			<h2>My choice</h2>
			<p>After many days of hardwork and research i came up with a overall design in my mind. I also took some help from different websites and images to collaborate the ideas into my personal web-site. The picture displayed above has been some of my influential designs. First of all, I liked thier way of delivering the contents in such a simple way. I got the idea of my homepage from picture no. 1 because its attractive. Picture no. 2 gave me a beautiful look to decorate my navigation bar whereas picture no. 3 was suitable for me to design my biography page. It was a perfect theme to display all my content along with a profile picture aside. As we have been told to create a CV page using flex-box property so, thought picture no. 4 would be a great design to include it into my web-page. As i was in confusion in creating my social page, I decided to take some help from picture no. 4 as I was influenced by the way it displayed the content. At last, I wanted my footer to be simple and attractive. So, picture no. 6 was quite helpful for me to give some idea to design my footer.</p>

			<p>As I started my project, there were few informal gatherings whith my fellow members where we discussed the desing aspect of the website On these group discussion, each of the member participated by giving their opinion and ideas along with their color combinations. By knowing each others views, we then decided a best solution for each group members.We also decided not to use float property as told by our module teacher beacuse float has been replaced by felx-box property. Flex also provide us variety of choice for us to use. As we created a simple webpage, we also didn't use grid property. This group meeting has helped us a lot during the process of making the website.</p>

			<p>Making of my personal portfolio was a slow and gradual developmental process. I started off my project with the ideas of my referenced images. As the time passed by, the group discussion helped me a lot to bring more and more beautiful and attractive changes resulting the best version of my website. </p>

			<h2>My Experience</h2>
			<p>The topic web development was completely new to me. I dedn't knew a single thing about it. But as I started knowing about it more and more day by day, it seemed quite interesting topic to explore. All the experience of me learning to code website in first term has been a wonderful journey from the start. I got to know about many new topics which i have never heard before. </p>

			<p>There were three major topics which a web developer should learn. They are HTML, CSS and Java Script. But, our first term focused on HTML and CSS. Firstly, I got the idea of the working mechanism of the website on internet. I understood the basic requirement(coding) an which website are built in. On weekly basis, I covered many different topic areas such as HTML elements, CSS syntax, box model, chrome developer tools, web fonts, layout and positio, responsive web design, google material design, HTML forms and many more. On the first day, we started off our learning process by the basic requirement of web development. In each week, we got to know about these topics in more detailed way. In addition, I also got to know how to associate variety of file type within web pages.</p>

			<p>Overall, my journey of learning web development has been great. Now, by knowing these basics rules and criterias of web development, I feel confident in building simple web pages. With the present knowledge, I am able to use proper and appropriate source and method to research the given topic related to webpage. Therefore, all my experience has been and will be very fruitful throughout my journey in web development. </p>
